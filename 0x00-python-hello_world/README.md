# Python with ALX-SE
## 0x00 Python - Hello World

This is a repository of the solutions to the `0x00. Python - Hello, World` student project of the ALX Software Engineering Programme.

The objective of this project is to learn and be able to explain clearly the following:
* Why Python programming is awesome
* Who created Python
* Who is Guido van Rossum
* Where does the name ‘Python’ come from
* What is the Zen of Python
* How to use the Python interpreter
* How to print text and variables using print
* How to use strings
* What are indexing and slicing in Python
