Databases can be relation or non-relational.

Relational databases are those that use the SQL syntax acronised by CRUD to Create, Read, Update, and Destroy data.
Non-relational databases aka NoSQL do not use the SQL syntax (this however happens some times).

Examples:
Relational DB
* MySQL
* PostgreSQL
* Oracle

NoSQL DB
* MongoDB
* CouchDB
