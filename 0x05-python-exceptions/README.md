## Python - Exceptions

This project involves solving tasks that help solidify the understanding of exceptions in Python, such as when to use them and how to use them.

To handle exception in Python, basically, `try` and `except` keywords are used. Other keywords include `else`, `finally`, and `raise`. Throughout the course of this project, these keywords will be put into use.
